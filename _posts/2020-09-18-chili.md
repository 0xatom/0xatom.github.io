## Summary

This one was a pretty tricky box that i enjoyed a lot! Is easy but you have to think smart. We start by brute forcing FTP this will give us access to all system files, we search for a writeable directory under `/var/www/html` and we place our shell there. Privilege escalation to root is easy, `/etc/passwd` is writeable. Let's pwn it! :sunglasses:

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Let's start as always with nmap.
