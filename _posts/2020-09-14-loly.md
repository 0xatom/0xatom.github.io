You can find the machine there > [Loly](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/loly-1,538/){:target="_blank"}

## Summary

This machine is an easy one, starting off we can find a wordpress installation and we gain access to it by running a brute force attack on the user. Shell uploading was a bit tricky, because common ways were blocked. After privilege escalation to first user was pretty easy we just have to look at wp-config file a really common method & the root one is based :sunglasses:

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance
