## Summary

Hello all! This box took me around 5-6 hours to pwn it for real, it's based on java stuff and i've no idea about java. I still don't know how did i pwn it haha, i guess im very lucky. Let’s pwn it! :sunglasses:

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Let's start as always with nmap.

```
$ ip=192.168.1.8                                                                                                                                                                 130 ↵

```

Let's start the enumeration with port 5000, if we check the source code of the main page we can see a cipher:

```
$ curl -s http://$ip:5000/ | tail -3
<!--GA DIE UHCEETASTTRNL-->
```

Tried some basic stuff like base64,rot13 etc but no luck. I fired up my favorite [Cipher Identifier](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier){:target="_blank"} Lot of results, i tried them all but only 1 worked the [Rail fence cipher](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/rail-fence-cipher){:target="_blank"}!

Tried the `GET AUTH CREDENTIALS` with lot of ways like `GET-AUTH-CREDENTIALS` but no luck, in the end was a path haha.

`http://$ip:5000/get/auth/credentials`

We can see a table with usernames & encrypted passwords:

Let's move now into FTP enumeration since we have anonymous allowed, we can see 2 files a `.txt` & `.jar` one. Let's download them.

```
$ wget -q ftp://$ip/pub/note.txt ; wget -q ftp://$ip/pub/warzone-encrypt.jar
```

Note.txt: `Attention, please encrypt always your password using the warzone-encrypt.jar`

The `.jar` file is a compressed version of java class files. If we run it asks from us to enter a password to encrypt it:

```
$ java -jar warzone-encrypt.jar 
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
Symmetric Encryption by Alienum
enter the password to encrypt : 0xatom
encrypted password : nhXDvhARNZDk54f7P/DpFg==
```

## Shell as

Now we need a java decompiler to move on, to understand the code of it and reverse it. I've no idea about java and stuff so i googled for one and i found this one [JD-GUI](http://java-decompiler.github.io/){:target="_blank"} You can simply install it using this command: `apt-get install jd-gui`
