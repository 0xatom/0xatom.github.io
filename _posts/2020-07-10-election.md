Hi all, this was a really easy box let's pwn it!

You can find the machine there > [eLection](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/election-1,503/){:target="_blank"}

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Let's start always with nmap.

```
$ ip=192.168.1.15
$ nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN initial $ip
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-07-10 00:35 EEST
Nmap scan report for election.zte.com.cn (192.168.1.15)
Host is up (0.00082s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
MAC Address: 00:0C:29:B2:39:C7 (VMware)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

When we visit the webpage, we can see the apache2 default page. I always check first for `robots.txt` and we see these directories:

```
admin
wordpress
user
election
```

Only the `/election` is working and it runs some kind of webapp (?) :

Let's run `gobuster` on it.

```
$ gobuster dir -q -u http://$ip/election/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,txt,html -o gobuster.txt
/media (Status: 301)
/themes (Status: 301)
/data (Status: 301)
/admin (Status: 301)
/index.php (Status: 200)
/lib (Status: 301)
/languages (Status: 301)
/js (Status: 301)
/card.php (Status: 200)
```

`/card.php` has binary data in let's decode them.

Perfect `1234:Zxc123!@#` we can login with them under `/admin`. Under settings now we can download some logs:

These logs have this in:

```
$ cat system.log 
[2020-01-01 00:00:00] Assigned Password for the user love: P@$$w0rd@123
[2020-04-03 00:13:53] Love added candidate 'Love'.

[2020-07-10 03:20:21] Love has been logged in from Unknown IP on Firefox (Linux).
```

We can use them with SSH.

```
$ ssh love@$ip
love@192.168.1.15's password:
