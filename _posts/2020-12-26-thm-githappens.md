## Summary

Hello all, i got bored of vulnhub and i'll focus on tryhackme only. Let's start with this awesome challenge! It's all about git enumeration to find a password, let's start!

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Now as always letâ€™s start with a nmap scan.

```
$ ip=10.10.18.139
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 $ip
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-26 15:51 EET
Warning: 10.10.18.139 giving up on port because retransmission cap hit (10).
Nmap scan report for 10.10.18.139 (10.10.18.139)
Host is up (0.53s latency).
Not shown: 38165 filtered ports, 27369 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 62.20 seconds

$ nmap -p 80 -sC -sV -oN nmap/githappens.thm $ip
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-12-26 15:53 EET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.18.139 (10.10.18.139)
Host is up (0.23s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
| http-git:
|   10.10.18.139:80/.git/
|     Git repository found!
|_    Repository description: Unnamed repository; edit this file 'description' to name the...
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Super Awesome Site!
```

Only 1 service that's good, once we visit it we can see a login page:

Tried some basic stuff like `admin:admin` etc but nothing seems to work, seems like a static page. Let's run a `gobuster` scan.

```
$ gobuster dir -q -u http://$ip/ -w $common -x php,txt,html -o scans/gobuster.txt
/.git/HEAD (Status: 200)
```

We have a `/.git` directory! That's great, i found an awesome [gitdumper tool](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools/blob/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh){:target="_blank"} to download .git repository from the webserver.

```
$ wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh
$ bash gitdumper.sh http://$ip/.git/ scans/results

## Getting The Flag

Perfect, now this reminds me of the DevOops box from hackthebox. We will use 2 commands:

```
git log = history of everything that happen to a repository.
git show = view details of the commit.
```

Running `git log` we can see lot of commits.

We will check every commit with the `git show` like this:

`$ git show 77aab78e2624ec9400f9ed3f43a6f0c942eeb82d`

This will take lot of time, so i coded a bash script to do this job! :D

```bash
for commits in $(git log | grep commit | cut -d ' ' -f2 | head -9)
do
	git show $commits | grep password
done
```

We have the flag (Note: i'll hide the flag because i want to submit the writeup to tryhackme platform):

```
$ bash flag.sh
...data...
+          password === "TRY_TO_GET_IT_ALONE"
```
