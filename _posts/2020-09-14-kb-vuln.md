You can find the machine there > [KB-VULN](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kb-vuln-1,540/){:target="_blank"}

## Summary

This machine is an easy one, from source code enumeration we can detect a username and ssh brute force with it. After gaining a low-privilege shell we can exploit motd daemon and change root password. Let's pwn it! :sunglasses:

## Enumeration/Reconnaissance

Let's start as always with nmap.
